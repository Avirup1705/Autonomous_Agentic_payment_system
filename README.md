# Autonomous Inventory Management & Agentic Payment System

An AI-powered inventory management platform that automatically monitors stock levels, predicts demand, triggers restocking, and executes supplier payments using autonomous agents and blockchain technology.

---

# Problem

Small retailers and supply chain operators often face challenges such as:

• manual inventory tracking
• delayed supplier payments
• stock shortages or overstocking
• inefficient procurement decisions

These problems reduce operational efficiency and increase business risk.

---

# Solution

This project introduces an **Autonomous Inventory Management System with Agentic Payments**.

The system uses AI to monitor inventory levels, predict product demand, automatically place restocking orders, and execute supplier payments securely using blockchain infrastructure.

---

# Key Features

• AI-based inventory demand prediction
• Autonomous restocking decisions
• Agent-based payment execution
• Blockchain transaction logging
• Real-time inventory dashboard
• Supplier management system
• Fraud and anomaly detection

---

# Tech Stack

Frontend
React + Vite + TypeScript

Backend
FastAPI / Node.js

AI / ML
Python (demand forecasting, anomaly detection)

Blockchain
Ethereum / Polygon Smart Contracts

Database
PostgreSQL / MongoDB

---

# How It Works

1. Inventory levels are continuously monitored
2. AI predicts upcoming demand
3. System triggers restocking when inventory drops below threshold
4. Supplier order is generated
5. Autonomous agent executes payment
6. Payment is recorded on blockchain
